# robotMap
## about:

  in this mission we try to make a simple map with the distance &amp; direction of the robot...

- our goals :
     1. create a web page to draw robot movement trajectory.
     2. save direction & distance to Data Base.
     3. make a web page to show the trajectory.
 
### Big challenge :

the big challenge was to make the button draw lines, also I was thinking of making the trajectory shown on the same page, and this was the biggest challenge ...

furthermore, I have one idea that did not go well, I hoped and tried hard to do it, but it did not work, and it take a lot of time, just this idea did not work.
this was the original idea :

but when taking distance from the user did not work I changed the plan " and that is the reason for the delay, I was trying very hard to make it work ", I make the 
distance fixed and this is how it looks now:

## buttons :

this image shows all buttons, we have 6 buttons, and every button makes a direction, except LastD --> which shows the last record in the database.

forward --> move to up .

backward--> move to down. 

Right--> moving in the right direction.

Left--> moving to the left direction.

stop--> do nothing, and has a distance of 0.

## canvas:

you can see in the canvas I draw simple directions, and I make the canvas on the same page with buttons by using div to separate the web page ...
ass I said above it was very challenging to figure out this idea, but I figure out in the end  ^_^

## database:

our database has 3 columns" Id, direction, distance "

### In the end I want to say :
this project let me know, how much the coding is fun and disturbing at the same time, but I have a lot of fun making it...
but when you want to be programming You must be patient.
